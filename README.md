Dear cloners,
	
Thanks for your interest in the advancement of this project.
After you have successfully cloned this repository, you have got to setup
the "parameters.yml" file, located in "/app/config". In your convenince,
there is template file named "parameters.yml.dist" in the same directory.
You could just rename it and configure the values, appropriate for being run
on your machine.

You then also have to download and install the dependancies of the project.
This can easily be accomplished by running "composer install" in the root
directory of project. The rest will be automatically handled by composer.
To get to know more about composer, check [this](http://symfony.com/doc/current/book/installation.html) out.
